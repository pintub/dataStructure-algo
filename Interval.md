- Always greedy problem `DON'T go into DP or Binary-Search`
- Solution involves sorting interval-pairs in increasing order of starting element & traverse input intervals  
  - During traversal, If overlapping encountered, then use some logic according problem
    - [Examples](./Leetcode/src/main/java/year2k21/common/pattern/interval)
      - Merge interval with previous interval Or
      - Eliminate a overlapping interval Or 
      - Count overlap Or
      - Count meeting rooms Or
    - `isOverlapping()` logic is challenging sometimes
