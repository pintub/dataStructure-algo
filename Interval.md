- Always greedy problem `DON'T go into DP or Binary-Search`.
- Solution involves sorting interval-pairs in increasing order of starting element & traverse input intervals  
  - During traversal, If overlapping encountered, then use some logic according problem
    - <u>`isOverlapping()`</u> logic is challenging sometimes 
    - [Examples](./Leetcode/src/main/java/year2k21/common/pattern/interval)
      - Merge interval with previous interval Or
      - Eliminate a overlapping interval Or 
      - Count overlap Or
      - Count meeting rooms Or
- Try all the possible scenarios when you are comparing 2 intervals by drawing diagrams on Paper
- Space complexity: O(2n)
  - One List is used to keep the result
  - One additional result int[][] array is used to return the result via "resultList.toArray(new int[][]{})"
