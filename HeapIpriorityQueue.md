### HEAP or PRIORITY-QUEUE

#### Basics
##### Heap Definition
- Complete Binary Tree (Refer Tree Doc)
- Max Heap, Parent > Both children => Parent => Both Sub-Trees, As ">" operation is associative 
##### Visual Representation vs Implementation
- Visually uses Tree, But implementation uses an array. Why Array, Because heap operations needs lots of random access like getParentIndex(childIndex) and getChildIndex(parentIndex) 
- <pre> 
  Class Heap {
    int[] arr;
    int countOfNodes;//V.V. Impl property, Used in many operations
  }
  </pre>
- Heap-Array is represented like level-order Traversal
<pre>
    11    
   /  \        ==> [11,12,13]    
  12    13  
</pre>
- leftChildIndex = 2 * parentIndex + 1, rightChildIndex = 2 * parentIndex + 2, parentIndex = (anyChildIndex - 1) / 2
##### Heap with Keys
If each node has 2 values, 1st value defines sorting order and 2nd value is just integer.
<pre> 
  Class Heap {
    Pair&lt;Key, Value&gt;[] arr;       //Node has Two info including key
    int countOfNodes;
  }
</pre>
##### Non-leaf * Leaf nodes
Non-leaf nodes = [1, (countOfNodes - 1)/2), leaf nodes = [(countOfNodes - 1)/2 + 1, n)
##### Insertion & Deletion
Insertion always at the last level & filled left to right, whereas Deletion always deletes the Root.
##### Heapify Up/Down
- heapifyUp(element): For insert(element) at the end, it might violate the Heap constraints, so heapify up to put the inserted value at correct position
  - Works iff upper part of tree is already heapified
- heapifyDown(element): For delete(root) at the Root, it might violate the Heap constraints, so heapify down.
  - Works iff lower part of tree is already heapified
  - :clown_face: Also `buildHeap(arr[])` uses heapifyDown() traversing bottom-up from 1st non-leaf to Root node(i.e, s1st non-leaf node = (countOfNodes-1)/2), whereas `heapSort(arr[])` uses heapifyDown()  traversing top-down from Root to till End

#### Problems
##### :rocket: Heap Problems
- insert(element) -> Uses heapifyUp()
- deleteMin() -> Uses heapifyDown()
- buildHeap(unsortedArray[]) `Note` O(n) time complexity very useful in many problems
  - Thought which comes to mind: Keep adding elements using above insert(element) n times, Time complexity will be O(nlogn)
  - Optimized version: Use heapifyDown() Starting from level= height-1 -> 1, Time complexity will be O(n). This O(n) is tough to prove
- heapSort(unsortedArray[]) -> Creates a sorted Array
  - Step1: buildHeap(unsortedArray[]) O(n)
  - Step2 In Loop: Keep pushing root element to end & heapifyDown(root) at lesser size tree. Lesser size tree can be achieved using "countOfNodes" property . This is inline sorting step & Time = O(nlogn).
  - <pre>
          1     Step1    2   Step2   3        (Step1 :1 & 3 swapped and heapifyDown(3) on array size =2)
        /  \     =>    /   \   =>   / \       (Step2 :3 & 2 swapped and heapifyDown(2) on array size =1)   
       2    3         3     1      2   1
      [1,2,3]         [2,3,1]     [3,2,1]
    </pre>
  - SO, HeapSort is also Time=O(nlogn) and space = O(1)
##### :rocket: Find max element in Min-Heap , Time= O(n/2) â‰ˆ O(n)
##### :rocket: Delete a non-Root element in Heap
- :bulb: 1.Search for element using level Order O(n) 2.Then delete in decreased Tree size, O(logn)
##### :rocket: print elements less than given integer =k in Min Heap
- :bulb: Just w/ Tree recursive traversal
##### :rocket: Merge 2 Heaps
- :bulb: Use buildHeap() for linear time
##### :rocket: Find Kth smallest element
- :bulb:
  - Approach-1 : DeleteMin() k times, Time=O(klogn), Space=O(1)
  - Approach-1 : Auxiliary Heap of O(k) ,each element in this Heap Pair<Element, indexOfElementInOriginalHeap> & Sorted by element value only . Time=O(klogk), Space=O(k)
  <pre>
    k=3                         Step1                     Step2                     Step3
            1           <1,0>     <2,1>//Del(<1,0>)       <3,3>//Popped <2,0>       <4,4>//Popped <3,3>
          /  \                     /   //Add(children)     / \ /Add(children)        /   //No Child of <4,4> 
          2  7                  <7,2>                   <7,2> <4,4>                 <7,2>
         / \
        3  4
      HeapOrig       HeapNew    Print Popped 1           Print Popped 2              Print Popped 3(Answer)
                                1's child added
                           For search/add, indexOfElementInOriginalHeap is needed 
  </pre>

##### :rocket: Stack using Heap
- :bulb: Use insertion order as PQ key
##### :rocket: Queue using Heap
- :bulb: Use insertion order as PQ key
##### :rocket: Merge k Sorted list
- :bulb: 
  - Exactly same as merging 2 sorted list
  - Build Heap using 1st elements of each list, O(k)
  - If deleteMin() of above heap and find next of the list where this deleted-node exists and Repeat this
  - Time = O(#Elementlogk)
##### :rocket: Median in steam of numbers
- :bulb: [Two Heap](./Leetcode/src/main/java/year2k21/common/pattern/two/heap/Solution295.java)

#### Tips
- Use buildHeap() wherever possible as it's O(n)
- Many times you will see Time complexity = O(klogn), Try converting it to O(klogk) by using Heap of k size
- If Median of stream of elements or in sliding window, Think of Two Heap
